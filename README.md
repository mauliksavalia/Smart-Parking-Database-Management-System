**Steps to run queries and test the database**
1.	Run “Final_db.sql” in “MySQL Workbench” to create schema and tables along with data preinserted.
2.	Open query files from “Queries/SQL_files” to run queries on that database.
3.	“Queries/Output photots” contains snapshots of the output of SQL queries.
4.	“Tables_csv” contains CSV files of data of all SQL tables.
5.	“Entries_data” contains information about number of rows and columns in each table and total number of entries in the database.
